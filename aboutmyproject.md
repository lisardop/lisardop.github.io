### GSoC 2022 Project: Improving the Visual Recognition of Aztec Hieroglyphs (Decipherment Tool)

Our aim is to enlarge the data set with added iconographic and hieroglyphic examples from other manuscript sources. A larger dataset will help us test the accuracy and improve the grade of matching with respect to users' tests (uploading hieroglyphs for mechanical decipherment). We will also establish a protocol of action and behavior between hieroglyphic texts and the previously created Machine Learning prototype. Finally, the results will be linked to potential entries in the *Visual Lexicon* dictionary and, in turn, the *Online Nahuatl Dictionary* where end-users can learn more about their images under study their visual characteristics and linguistic meanings.

### GSoC 2021 Project: Depicting of Graphical Communication Systems (GCS) in Aztec/Central Mexican manuscripts with Deep Learning: glyphic visual recognition and deciphering using Keras

Among all the human writing communication systems and inspired by Google Arts & Culture project Fabricius, we propose the creation of a framework to identify glyphs in Aztec/Central Mexican codex and classifying their Graphical Communication System (GCS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Aztec Codex & Visual Recognition

The [Visual Recognition of Aztec Hieroglyphs](https://aztecglyphrecognition.herokuapp.com/) is based on [Visual Lexicon of Aztec Hieroglyphs](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/) ed. Stephanie Wood, focused in early 16th-century **Mendoza Codex** from Mexico and related.
