subtitle: Multimodal Graphic Communication System & Visual Recognition

Among all the human writing communication systems and inspired by Google Arts & Culture project Fabricius, we propose the creation of a framework to identify glyphs in Aztec/Central Mexican codex and classifying their Graphical Communication System (GCS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Aztec Codex & Visual Recognition

The [Visual Lexicon of Aztec Hieroglyphs](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/) ed. Stephanie Wood, is focused in early 16th-century **Mendoza Codex** from Mexico.
