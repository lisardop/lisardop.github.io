### GSoC 2021 Project: Depicting of Graphical Communication Systems (GCS) in Aztec/Central Mexican manuscripts with Deep Learning: glyphic visual recognition and deciphering using Keras

Among all the human writing communication systems and inspired by Google Arts & Culture project Fabricius, we propose the creation of a framework to identify glyphs in Aztec/Central Mexican codex and classifying their Graphical Communication System (GCS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Aztec Codex & Visual Recognition

The [Visual Lexicon of Aztec Hieroglyphs](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/) ed. Stephanie Wood, is focused in early 16th-century **Mendoza Codex** and related from Mexico.
