## WEEK 1 Reshape existing images
*13 - 19 JUN*

We have a bunch of Codex Mendoza files from our previous GSoC project (more files are going to be added soon):
- Simplex (209): glyph is a whole unity
- Compound (364): glyph is a block of minor unities
- Atomic (714): minor unities isolated
- Iconography (12): another elements depicted, not logographyc glyphs but related
- Everything (1295): all previous files in same folder
- Augmented (6431): all glyphs of previous folder were shifted/rotate and generate an artificial expanded dataset made by Tarun.

![acatepecaugmented](/assets/img/Acatepec_augmented.jpg)

*This is an example of augmented compound glyph 'Acatepec'*

A successful match for the algorithm is determined by figure colours and its shape/position. We consider framing (250x250 or 500x500) a couple of testing images, with a small margin and transparent background or emulating light-brown paper (stored as PNG instead JPG/JPEG files to maintain transparency):

![ahuatepectransparentpaper](/assets/img/Ahuatepec_transparent_paper.jpg)

*Ahuatepec original glyph in JPG, and transparent and paper-color glyphs 500x500 stored as PNG extension*

Another problem we are dealing with is the optimal way to name files. Theoretically, the name of the file is irrelevant when the image is processed, but we want to link it to its glyphic value and with potential entries in the visual dictionary.

There are two options for this task:
- Implement a way to obtain the info from the Drupal DB, with the cost of time and complexity that may arise.
- Rename files so Python code can extract it as a kind of metadata, print it on screen and build the web link for entries in the dictionary.

The second option could be something like this: name-type-pagination-source-extrainfo.png

I.E. : 

![ahuatloaktree](/assets/img/ahuatloaktree.jpg)

*ahuatl-atomic-21v-Mendoza-oaktree-Ahuatepec.png*

But we have the Visual Lexicon entries under this form: 

https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/[ahuatl-21v](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/ahuatl-21v)

![ahuatlvisuallexicon](/assets/img/ahuatl_visual_lexicon.jpg)

or from other codices (AGN, Tierras, vol. 1871, exp. 1 = t18711):

https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/[20-matl-t18711](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/20-matl-t18711)

So in our example, the 'real' image-relate expected link is:

https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/[ahuatl-21v](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/content/ahuatl-21v)

From there, there is an internal link to Online Nahuatl Dictionary:

![ahuatlvisuallexicondetail](/assets/img/ahuatl_visual_lexicon_detail.jpg)

https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/[ahuatl](https://nahuatl.uoregon.edu/content/ahuatl)

![ahuatlOND](/assets/img/ahuatl_OND.jpg)

Another temporal solution should be just get the glyph name in the first filename position an establish a search-link, so user can check all available entries for Visual Lexicon:

https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/fulltext-quick-search?search_api_views_fulltext=[ahuatl](https://aztecglyphs.uoregon.edu/fulltext-quick-search?search_api_views_fulltext=ahuatl)

![ahuatlsearch](/assets/img/ahuatl_search.jpg)



## WEEK 2 Capture, edit, crop and delete surrounding material in glyphs. Expand the dataset as needed.
*20 - 26 JUN*

'Matrícula de Tributos' (ca. 1520-30) is a best candidate for expand the dataset (as we have so few examples of each glyph) but the algorythm showed a not so bad accuracity but failed when the same glyph was light or very dark colored. This is the main problem to deal with Matrícula de Tributos. It has 31 painted sheets of indigenous paper, amate (while Codex Mendoza, ca. 1540 was made in European paper). Some sheets of Matricula de Tributos have lost some parts of the fibers and having a light-brown color due its antiquity and conservation. Although, some painted figures are partial lost or colour-vanished, so we decided to edit them with software and get the most possible approach to its 'original' paiting brightness.

These are some of our results using the free images available in [World Digital Library](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_03248/):

![MT1comp](/assets/img/MT_1comp.jpg)

*Matrícula de Tributos, sheet 1, very damaged*

![MT1comp29](/assets/img/MT_1comp29.jpg)

*Matrícula de Tributos, sheet 29. Black, green, blue and red are the most vanished*

Here, a quick example of a glyph cropped and compared with our previous dataset:

![Amaxacexamples](/assets/img/Amaxac_examples.jpg)

*Comparson between codices and digital treatments: A. Non retouched glyph 'Amaxac' in Codex Mendoza; B. 'Amaxac' in our existing dataset; C. Non-retouched glyph 'Amaxac' in Matrícula de Tributos; D. Same glyph colour-contrasted; E. Previous example cropped with a paper-color background (500x500).*
