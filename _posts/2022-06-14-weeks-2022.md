## WEEK 1 Reshape existing images
*13 - 19 JUN*

We have a bunch of files from previous GSoC proyect (more files are going to be added soon):
- Simplex (209): glyph is a whole unity
- Compound (364): glyph is a block of minor unities
- Atomic (714): minor unities isolated
- Iconography (12): another elements depicted, not logographyc glyphs but related
- Everything (1295): all previous files in same folder
- Augmented (6431): all glyphs of previous folder were shifted/rotate and generate an artificial expanded dataset made by Tarun.

![acatepecaugmented](/assets/img/Acatepec_augmented.jpg)

This is an example of augmented compound glyph 'Acatepec'

As a successful match of an algorithm is determined by figure colours and its shape/position, we consider framing (250x250 or 500x500) a couple of testing images, with a small margin and transparent background or emulating light-brown paper (stored as PNG instead JPG/JPEG files to maintain transparency):

![ahuatepectransparentpaper](/assets/img/Ahuatepec_transparent_paper.jpg)

Ahuatepec original glyph in JPG, and transparent and paper-color glyphs 500x500 stored as PNG extension
