## WEEK 1 Reshape existing images
*13 - 19 JUN*

We have a bunch of files from previous GSoC proyect (more files are going to be added soon):
- Simplex (209): glyph is a whole unity
- Compound (364): glyph is a block of minor unities
- Atomic (714): minor unities isolated
- Iconography (12): another elements depicted, not logographyc glyphs but related
- Everything (1295): all previous files in same folder
- Augmented (6431): all glyphs of previous folder were shifted/rotate and generate an artificial expanded dataset made by Tarun.

This is an example of augmented compound glyph 'Acatepec'

As the algorithm is determined by its color and shape position, we considered to frame (250x250 or 500x500) a couple of testing images, with a small margin  and transparent background or emulating light-brown paper:
