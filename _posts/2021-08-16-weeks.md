## WEEK 1
*7 - 13 JUN*

We had an online meeting with Mentors and decided split the project in two main areas:
- Machine Learning algorythm using TensorFlow, deploying by Tarun
- Server work and connectivity between the code and the Aztec glyphs app hosted in Uni. Oregon's servers (by me)

We have decided if we could have a functional prototype before the mid evaluation project.

Then, a local copy of all glyphs hosted in the Web app for a first review was provided by Stephanie. I get in contact with the server system admin Len for specifications and evaluating the best way for server connection without compromise data or files. All the project work would be dumped in U. Oregon's server.

The main concept for the project is:
- Integrate a form or end-user webpage for upload images.
- Provide images to the prototype via libraries or some kind of API.
- A prototype working with CPU (non-GPU).
- The result of prediction comes back to the user via webpage (Drupal Form API)
- New info and users images are stored in filesystem and DB tables.

## WEEK 2
*14 - 20 JUN*

I was in contact with Len, U. Oregon Admin Server for further specifications.
We need to deploy a development environment as follows:

- Create a Virtual Machine with 2 cores and 4 GB RAM.
- RedHat 7 Enterprise or CentOS for a non-GPU enviroment as OS.
- Do not reach more than 40 GB of virtual disk availability.

A initial Machine Learning protype was provided for the team via Google Colab by Tarun.

## WEEK 3
*21 - 27 JUN*

At this point and reviewed glyphs labels and storage, I started to do:

- Create a couple of VM with CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 20.4, just in case.
- Config a LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) in them
- Install and config Drupal 8/9 structure for image info stored in the DB (MariaDB)


## WEEK 4
*28 JUN - 4 JUL*

This week I would prepare the structure of folders and DB objects, as in U. Oregon server

- The glyph images are hosted in /var/www/html/aztecglyphs/sites/default/files
- More accurated new glyphs was provided by Stephanie as a ZIP.
- I create a new database labeled: aztecglyphs
- I create the table for images info stored, labeled: file_managed

~~~
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `file_managed` (
  `fid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'File ID.',
  `uid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'The users.uid of the user who is associated with the file.',
  `filename` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' COMMENT 'Name of the file with no path components. This may differ from the basename of the URI if the file is renamed to avoid overwriting an existing file.',
  `uri` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '' COMMENT 'The URI to access the file (either local or remote).',
  `filemime` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' COMMENT 'The fileâ€™s MIME type.',
  `filesize` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'The size of the file in bytes.',
  `status` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'A field indicating the status of the file. Two status are defined in core: temporary (0) and permanent (1). Temporary files older than DRUPAL_MAXIMUM_TEMP_FILE_AGE will be removed during a cron run.',
  `timestamp` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'UNIX timestamp for when the file was added.',
  `type` varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'undefined' COMMENT 'The type of this file.'
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='Stores information for uploaded files.';

-- Indexes for dumped tables

-- Indexes for table `file_managed`
--
ALTER TABLE `file_managed`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`fid`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `uri` (`uri`),
  ADD KEY `uid` (`uid`),
  ADD KEY `status` (`status`),
  ADD KEY `timestamp` (`timestamp`),
  ADD KEY `file_type` (`type`);

-- AUTO_INCREMENT for dumped tables

ALTER TABLE `file_managed`
  MODIFY `fid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'File ID.';

## WEEK 5
*5 - 11 JUL*

This week I am going to import the updated model provided by Tarun.

- Install Anaconda 3 and possible libraries used by ML model.
- Export Colab notebook and import to Jupyter notebook.
- Have a success import Machine Learning model to the VM filesystem.
- Test if running is OK.
