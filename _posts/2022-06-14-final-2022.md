## END OF THE PROJECT

My part of the project is available [here](https://github.com/lisardop/GSoC2022) (prerequisites, steps and final code version) plus new glyphs dataset self-elaborated from ['Matricula de Tributos' codex](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q0ld6ir0r2n2pn7/AAAjLrmcFfLra2mOe4tE7EZRa?dl=0)

Finally, the code was deployed also in UOregon's server, as [AztecGlyphRecognition URL](https://aztecglyphrecognition.wired-humanities.org/)

And a functional mirror-URL is provided in Heroku for [Aztec Glyphs Recognition v.2](https://aztecglyphrecognition.herokuapp.com)

# Further steps

As a result of our summer work, these are the future steps that might be done:

- Normalized all future image fileenames with same pattern.

- Do not use forbidden characters in filenames such as "&, !, ", ', $, ?" and so on.

- Peripherical material could show abnormal results due to the low glyph variability (in some cases no more than 2 o 3 examples in dataset)

- Transparent background is converted to white by the algorythm. So white background should be the best option due to a RGB (0,0,0) value (black is 255,255,255). So any peripherical material or background color in user's image will have same cosine distance to glyph dataset in full white background

- Mobilenet algorythm using keras was acceptable for this early version. But due to comparson of full visual pixel matrix, another algorythms should be more accurated. Just as a example, another Red Hen Lab GSoC 2022 project by Rishab Mudliar](https://lazycodes7.github.io/posts/) could fit with this task.

- Next codex to incorporate due to high percentil similarity will be Osuna Codex, Telleriano-Remensis, Vaticanus A, Matr√≠cula de Huexotzinco, Tovar or Aubin, just as examples
